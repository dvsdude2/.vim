3. How to Download YouTube Thumbnail by a Custom URL?
You can also download YouTube thumbnail by a direct url. Let us see how it can done using this method:

Get the ID of the YouTube video. Just open that video on YouTube and a long address will appear has some random letters and numbers that come after the equals sign. This is the actual video ID that you need to use to download the thumbnail.

All the YouTube thumbnails can be accessed using the same URL. You only need to go to the url in the picture below.

----------------
On a Mac, just drag the thumbnail to your desktop. On Windows (and Linux, I suppose), I’d use Chrome or Firefox. Righ click the thumbnail and select “Inspect Element” or “Inspect” depending on the browser. The HTML element containing the thumbnail is then revealed, and you may copy the URL to the thumbnail image. Paste the URL into your browser, and save the image.
